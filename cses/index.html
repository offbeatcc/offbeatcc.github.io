  The primary reference resources for these meetings are
  the <a href="https://cses.fi/problemset/">CSES Problem Set</a>
  and <a href="https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf">Competitive
    Programmer's Handbook (Antti Laaksonen)</a>. Both resources are
  freely available on the web.
</p>
<p>
  These meetings are hosted
  by <a href="https://github.com/susam">Susam</a> from
  the <a href="https://web.libera.chat/#offbeat">#offbeat</a>
  channel of Libera IRC network. These meetings will likely be
  attended by some members of this channel, other related
  channels, as well as by some members
  from <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>.
</p>
<p>
  These meetings are open to anyone who is willing to join and study
  the reference book and the problem set with us. Note that silently
  lurking is considered completely fine in our meetings. In fact, most
  members of the club join in and stay silent throughout the meetings.
  Only a few members talk via audio/video or chat. This is considered
  absolutely normal in our meetings, so please do not hesitate to join
  our meetings!
